# On-a-bayesian-change-point-detection-model-for-multivariate-data
Change point detection problem is key in anomaly detection, relevant and fast-growing. This R code implements a Bayesian approach to tackle this problem with multivariate data. Here are helper functions, validating simulations and two applications: Covid-19 and finance, as well as a report explaining the model.
